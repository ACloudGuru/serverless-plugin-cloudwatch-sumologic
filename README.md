# serverless-plugin-cloudwatch-sumologic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ACloudGuru/serverless-plugin-cloudwatch-sumologic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ACloudGuru/serverless-plugin-cloudwatch-sumologic)
Plugin which auto-subscribes a log delivery lambda function to lambda log groups created by Serverless

# Installation
`npm install --save-dev serverless-plugin-cloudwatch-sumologic`

# Configuration
1. First follow [this guide](https://help.sumologic.com/Send_Data/Sources/HTTP_Source) to create a new collector and http source on Sumologic.
2. Add the following custom variables to your `serverless.yml` file.
    ```
    custom:
        shipLogs:
            # Required
            collectorUrl: Paste your url from step 1. here
            # Optional, default pattern is "[timestamp=*Z, request_id=\"*-*\", event]"
            filterPattern: "[timestamp=*Z, request_id=\"*-*\", correlation_id=\"*-*\", event]"
    ```

# How it works
This plugin automates the process described in the [readme](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-aws-lambda/tree/master/cloudwatchlogs/README.md) provided by Sumologic.

Upon running `sls deploy` it will...

1. Create a temporary function in the root of your serverless project
2. Add that function to the in-memory CloudFormation script created by the serverless framework
3. Iterate through all the functions (except for the sumologic one) and generate:
    1. CloudFormation log group resources that match the ones that are usually automatically generated by lambda when your functions run.
    2. CloudFormation Subscription Filter resources linking the aforementioned log groups to the sumologic lambda function.
4. Wait for the stack creation/update to complete and then delete the temporarily created function source directory.

# Caveats
If you have already created your serverless stack and have run any of your functions, then you will need to remove your stack
completely using `sls remove`. This is because the CloudFormation script generated by this plugin will try and take control of the log
groups. If you don't do this, you'll find that stack updates will throw errors. 

We will work to move this functionality into API calls instead of using CloudFormation in the future to get around this issue.
